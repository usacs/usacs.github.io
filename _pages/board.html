          <p>Hey guys, my name is Sibi and I'm gonna be your Co-President this year! A little about me, I'm currently a Junior double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science, with a minor in Math. I'm an avid anime/manga head — I love One Piece, DBZ, Bleach, Naruto, Akira, Berserk and a plethora more. I'm also a fan of multiple sports like Soccer, Lacrosse, and Basketball. As your Co-President, I want to demonstrate how truly amazing the CS space can be and help you make the most out of it. I hope to inspire you all to appreciate the CS community and become eager members. I honestly cannot wait to see what this year has in store for us!!</p>

          <p class="title">Co-President</p>
          <p>Yo! I'm Rushd, Co-President for the year. I'm currently a rising Junior majoring in CS and Philosophy. As President, I'll be working to realize my vision for RUCS — a diverse community, where everyone has ample resources to succeed and close friends to enjoy their journey — while supporting the other directors in realizing their own visions. Outside of academic endeavors, you can often find me on my longboard around campus, playing lax with the other USACS eboard members, or exploring random parts of campus. I can't wait to see you all around! 
            Feel free to reach out @ rushd.syed@rutgers.edu</p>

          <p>Nice to meet you! I'm Angela, and I am a sophomore double majoring in Computer Science and Math. Outside of the classroom, I like to explore and learn new things, eat food, and workout. If circumstances allow (aka if I have the resources), I also dance and play the piano. As your fellow Education Director, I thrive to make USACS the pillar that supports the Rutgers's CS student body. Regardless of whether it is topics related to in-class materials, personal interests, networking and mentorship guidance, or internship applications, USACS and I will try our best to provide our eager learners with the help and guidance needed! If you have any questions or simply wish to connect, I am only an email away: jx276@scarletmail.rutgers.edu.
